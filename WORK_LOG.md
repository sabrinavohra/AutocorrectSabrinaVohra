| 3/5  |  2:35 - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                        I started brainstorming in class. I thought through different ways to shorten the list of words into a smaller group of candidates. The only concrete, easily applicable idea was to shorten the list through sorting by word length. |
| 3/6  | 12:55 - 1:45pm  |                                                                                                        I continued brainstorming in class and started writing down some ideas. Rather than thinking about edit distance, I started thinking through the other steps in the process. I continued thinking about how to narrow the list of candidates but didn't have any very exciting ideas. |
| 3/9  | 11:25 - 11:55am |                                                                                                            I continued brainstorming about the structure of the program and process it should follow and wrote out some ideas. I also started declaring and initializing variables I thought I would need for my program. I wrote out the series of steps that the code needs to go through. |
| 3/12 | 11:40 - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I worked on my edit distance method. I am trying to figure out how to approach it using tabulation in a for-loop. I have soome small problems with using recursion versus tabulation. |
| 3/14 |  9:05 - 9:55am  |                                                                                                             I worked on the tabulation method for edit distance and was able to find the right words by splitting up the for-loops. I started working on sorting by edit distance and alphabetically. I am trying to find a system to sort by edit distance while not redundantly searching. |
| 3/16 | 12:30 - 1:00pm  | I thought of ways to sort the ArrayList by edit distance and then alphabetically. I struggled to find an efficient way to approach the problem, the best idea I've come up with thus far is to make separate ArrayLists for each threshold value, sort those alphabetically, and then add all of them to one big ArrayList. However, I am struggling with making ArrayLists and naming them. |
| 3/17 |  2:10 - 3:00pm  |                                                I was struggling to think of ways to sor the words efficiently. Mr. Blick helped me come up with the idea of making an Array of ArrayLists to sort the words before adding them to the final Array. This worked to make that part of the process work, but the largest test case still isn't passed and is finding the wrong number of words. |
| 3/17 |  6:50 - 7:20pm  |                                                                                                                    I continued working through the problem I'm having with the largest test case, using the debugger. I was able to find the words that were causing problems and causing the length of the array to be longer. However, I still can't find where the mistake is being made. |
| 3/17 | 10:20 - 10:50pm |                                                            I continued thinking about where the mistake was and found that my edit distance method is classifying some words with an edit distance of 3 as having an edit distnace of 2. I think it has to do with the length of these words being short. I am trying to add an if statement to catch these words, but it isn't working yet. |
