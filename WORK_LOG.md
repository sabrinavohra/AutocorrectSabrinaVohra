| 3/5  |  2:35 - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                        I started brainstorming in class. I thought through different ways to shorten the list of words into a smaller group of candidates. The only concrete, easily applicable idea was to shorten the list through sorting by word length. |
| 3/6  | 12:55 - 1:45pm  |                                                                                                        I continued brainstorming in class and started writing down some ideas. Rather than thinking about edit distance, I started thinking through the other steps in the process. I continued thinking about how to narrow the list of candidates but didn't have any very exciting ideas. |
| 3/9  | 11:25 - 11:55am |                                                                                                            I continued brainstorming about the structure of the program and process it should follow and wrote out some ideas. I also started declaring and initializing variables I thought I would need for my program. I wrote out the series of steps that the code needs to go through. |
| 3/12 | 11:40 - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I worked on my edit distance method. I am trying to figure out how to approach it using tabulation in a for-loop. I have soome small problems with using recursion versus tabulation. |
| 3/14 |  9:05 - 9:55am  |                                                                                                             I worked on the tabulation method for edit distance and was able to find the right words by splitting up the for-loops. I started working on sorting by edit distance and alphabetically. I am trying to find a system to sort by edit distance while not redundantly searching. |
| 3/16 | 12:30 - 1:00pm  | I thought of ways to sort the ArrayList by edit distance and then alphabetically. I struggled to find an efficient way to approach the problem, the best idea I've come up with thus far is to make separate ArrayLists for each threshold value, sort those alphabetically, and then add all of them to one big ArrayList. However, I am struggling with making ArrayLists and naming them. |

To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
