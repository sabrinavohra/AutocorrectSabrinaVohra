# **Autocorrect**

##### A word-suggestion algorithm that prints dictionary words for any given typed and misspelled word! 

The program begins by checking if the word exists in the dictionary. If not, it compares it to each word in the dictionary
and checks the edit distance (how many changes must be made for the word to become the other word); if the distance is within
a certain range, it will add the word to a final list. Then, the program prints out the final list of words organized by 
edit distance and then alphabetically. 

#### Type your word into the terminal to begin!!
